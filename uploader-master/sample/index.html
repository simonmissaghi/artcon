        <p>In most browsers, you can drag and drop files from your
          computer onto the form above. Enter your name and click
          "Upload" to watch the progress bar. <br><br>

        <p>Every upload will fail because the server (in this case,
          GitHub), doesn't accept form submissions. <br><br>
        
        <p>I suggest adding large files (> 1 MB) or they tend to
          upload too quickly and you can't see the progress
          notification. <br><br>

        <p>If you add too many files, the upload button will scroll off
          the bottom of the list. Don't do that.<br><br>
          
        <p>Internet Explorer (except version 10) does not support drag
          and drop or progress notifications. You can still add files one
          at a time with the file picker, but you won't see a nice progress
          bar as they upload.
